  \remark     Ported for Focused Flight 32.
  \remark     The STM32Fs CRC engine uses the same polynomial as CRC32B (i.e.
              ethernet) but shifts in the oposite direction. __REVs are added
              to fix this, which shouldn't effect executino much as the CRC
              engine takes 4 clocks to execute.
